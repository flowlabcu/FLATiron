About
-------

FLow And Transport Finite element or FLATiron (Fe == iron) is a toolkit used to solve coupled flow physics problems via the Finite Element Method. 
The finite element backend of FLATiron is based on FEniCS DOLFINx. FLATiron is a hierarchical, modular, finite element library for flow physics and 
transport phenomena. This toolkit is based on the open-source finite element library named `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org/>`_, and leverages the underlying 
DOLFINx and Unified Form Language (ufl) modules heavily in its design. The library has been developed based on research and development activities 
at the FLOWLab at University of Colorado Boulder.
