FLATiron as an API
======================

These are demos for on how to use the FLATiron library API to define a more complex physics problem which the is not covered in the application side of FLATiron. The developer will need to know some python programming along with basic knowledge of `legacy FEniCS <https://olddocs.fenicsproject.org/dolfin/2019.1.0/python/>`_. These demos will show implementations of basic problems with some extensions using the FLATiron API.
